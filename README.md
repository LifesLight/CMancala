# CMancala

## Overview
CMancala is a computer implementation of the classic board game Mancala. This version supports both standard Mancala rules and an **Avalanche** mode, providing an engaging challenge with a sophisticated AI opponent.

## Rules
The game adheres to basic Mancala rules. In addition, an **Avalanche** mode is available, offering a different style of gameplay.

## Command-Line Arguments
CMancala supports several command-line arguments to configure gameplay:
- `--stones <number>`: Sets the number of stones per cell with a standard distribution.
- `--rstones <number>`: Sets the number of stones in total with a random distribution.
- `--time <seconds>`: Sets an approximate thinking time for the AI.
- `--depth <number>`: Sets the depth for the Negamax algorithm; if specified, overrides the time-based search.
- `--ai-start`: The AI will make the first move.
- `--human-start`: The human player will make the first move (default).

## Performance
The AI operates on a single thread, and its performance varies based on the game's state:<br>
- It typically anticipates 20-30 moves within a 5-second thinking window, influenced by the number of stones on the board.<br>
- With 4 stones per cell, the AI reaches a very high level of play in about 60 seconds.<br>
- Games with fewer stones per cell enhance the AI's performance.<br>
- As the game progresses, the AI's ability to predict moves improves.<br>

When the AI starts the game, it becomes almost unbeatable, demonstrating its effectiveness with even a brief moment to think.

These benchmarks are approximate and might slightly differ across various CPUs.<br>
Observations were made on an M2 Pro, but similar performance is expected on modern processors due to the exponential nature of the problem.<br>




## Algorithm
CMancala employs a Negamax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, tailored to accommodate double moves. Key features include:
- **Double Move Handling**: The algorithm adjusts search parameters based on whether the player's turn continues or switches to the opponent.
- **Aspiration Windows with Iterative Deepening**: This technique allows for time-limited searches while enhancing performance.

## Restrictions
- The game is designed to support a maximum of 224 stones on the board at any given time.
- The game mode needs to be specified before compilation in `board.h`.

## Interface
- CMancala features a terminal-based user interface. Users interested in a graphical interface may consider developing a simple web-based UI.
